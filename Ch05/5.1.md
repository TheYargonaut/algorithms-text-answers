# 5.1 Exercises

1. It implies there are not cycles (a la rock-paper-scissors); that is, if A > B and B > C, then A > C. Which is the very thing that was to be showed.

2. Consider first a proceedure `Random( 0, c )`, where $c=b-a$. Obviously, `Random( a, b )` can be implemented by adding $a$ to the result of `Random( 0, c )`. Now, consider one further, `Random( 0, d )`, where $d=2^{\lceil{\lg{c}}\rceil}-1$. `Random( 0, c )` can be implemented by calling `Random( 0, d )` until the result is in the range $(0,c)$; any given call will produce a valid result with at least a 50% chance, and the repeated call on invalid values will produce a uniform distribution over the valid range. Finally, `Random( 0, d )` may be implemented with `Random( 0, 1 )` by considering the binary representation of $d$ and producing each place-value with the result of a call to `Random( 0, 1 )`.
The expected running time, which relies on the number of calls to `Random( 0, 1 )`, is $\Theta(\lg{(b-a)})$

3. Make two calls to Biased-Random; if the `XOR` of the results is true, return the result of the first call. The expected runtime is $\Theta(\frac{1}{2}(p*(1-p))^{-1})$
