2. Transfer preserves order of equal inputs. Tedious to state rigorously, see [here](https://ita.skanev.com/08/02/02.html)

3. It works, but it is no longer stable; it is in fact inverse of stable (puts equal elements into sorted array in reverse order)

4. Construct array C from counting sort (state at line 9), which is in essense a cumulative distribution of the elements. Return `C[b] - C[a-1]` (or just `C[b]` if `a=0`).

Personal question: is it possible to make a version of Counting Sort which sorts in-place (and is still stable? and linear time?)\
Idea 1: exchange index to be sorted with new index. Maintaining the counts correctly would be difficult, and certainly would not be stable. Rejected.
Current answer: No
