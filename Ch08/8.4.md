2. Worst case occurs when all elements fall in one bin and are in reverse order.\
   Use a different sorting algorithm (namely heap sort if taking advantage of order of insertion, or using merge sort for sorting after the buckets are created) for sorting each bucket after partitioning the list.

3. $(E[X])^2=(\frac{0+1+1+2}{4})^2=1, E[X^2]=\frac{0^2+1^2+1^2+2^2}{4}=\frac{3}{2}$

4. The area between two radii $d_i,d_j$ is $\pi(d_i^2-d_j^2)$. As such, the bin boundaries for this sort are the square roots of a linear uniformly distributed bucket sort, such that for $m$ buckets, boundary $b_i=\sqrt\frac{i}{m}$

5. That's a CDF, not a PDF. You can tell because it monotonically increases and has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1. PDFs are integrated to produce CDFs. Oof. Any way, just bucket sort (with $m$ linear $\frac{1}{m}$-sized buckets) on the $P(X_i)$ instead of the values of $X_i$. This makes it equivalent to the uniformly distributed case, which has already been shown to be linear in the average case.
