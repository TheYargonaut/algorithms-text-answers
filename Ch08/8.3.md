2. insertion sort and merge sort are stable; heapsort and quicksort are not.\
   Simple scheme, create a second array (call it `J`) of the same size as A with values equal to their indices; use the same motions on `J` as on the values in A. Once A is sorted, sort any blocks of equal values based on the corresponding values in `J`. This will yeild a stable sort in at most a constant factor (namely 2) of space and worst-casetime over the original sort (so $O(n)$ space, time depends on the sorting algorithm)

3. Brief rather than rigorous: sort on position k. After sorting on position k+1 **with stable sort** the numbers described by positions k and k+1 together are sorted correctly. Going from position 0 to position n will therefore sort the entire set correctly.

4. Radix sort with 2-digit numbers of base $n$, which is $\Theta(2(n+n))=\Theta(n)$

5. It would take $O(10^d)$ passes and $O(10d)$ piles (note that radix sort reduces this to worst case $d$ sorting passes and only 1 pile).
