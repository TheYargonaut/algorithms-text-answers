3. Assume The Min-Heap helper functions (MIN-HEAPIFY, PARENT) exist
   ```
   HEAP-MINIMUM( A )
      return A[ 1 ]
   
   HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN( A )
      if A.heap-size < 1
         error "heap underflow"
      min = A[ 1 ]
      A[ 1 ] = A[ A.heap-size ]
      A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
      MIN-HEAPIFY( A, 1 )
      return min
   
   HEAP-DECREASE-KEY( A, i, key )
      if key > A[ i ]
         error "new key greater than current key"
      A[ i ] = key
      while i > 1 and A[ PARENT( i ) ] > A[ i ]
         exchange A[ i ] with A[ PARENT( i ) ]
         i = PARENT( i )
   
   MIN-HEAP-INSERT( A, key )
      A.heap-size = A.heap-size + 1
      A[ heap-size ] = INF
      HEAP-DECREASE-KEY( A, heap-size, key )
   ```

4. To avoid tripping the assertion in line 1 of HEAP-DECREASE-KEY (more precisely, maintains A as a max heap as expected by HEAP-DECREASE-KEY).

5. Initialization: trivially true by definition of max-heap and given assumption
   Maintenance: sets up for next iteration (where $i=PARENT(i)$) by moving `A[i]` as necessary. Since it was the only exception, it is resolved at that level.
   Termination: Condition checks if `A[i]` is an exception and terminates if not (or if it is the root, but this is equivalent). Therefore at loop termination A will be a valid max-heap.

6. Just give the pseudocode of the single-assign version:
   ```
   HEAP-INCREASE-KEY( A, i, key )
      if key < A[ i ]
         error "new key less than current key"
      while i > 1 and A[ PARENT( i ) ] < key
         A[ i ] = A[ PARENT( i ) ]
         i = PARENT( i )
      A[ i ] = key
   ```

7. Implement 'push' and 'pop' for each. Same assumption on A being a max-heap. Since we're ommitting the handles to objects, just require that the elements are popped as the proper fuction of the order of their pushing. For the FIFO queue, `A` has a new property `A.min` which holds the minimum value in the queue.
   ```
   FIFO-PUSH( A )
      if A.heap-size < 1
         A.min = 0 // would normally be some maximum value storable in the int type
      else
         A.min = A.min - 1
      MAX-HEAP-INSERT( A, A.min )

   FIFO-POP( A )
      return HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX( A )

   STACK-PUSH( A )
      key = 0
      if A.heap-size > 0
         key = HEAP-MAXIMUM( A ) + 1
      MAX-HEAP-INSERT( A, key )

   STACK-POP( A )
      return HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX( A )
   ```

8. It is a problem of which HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX is a special case.
   ```
   HEAP-DELETE( A, i )
      if A.heap-size < i
         error "heap underflow"
      A[ i ] = A[ A.heap-size ]
      A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
      MAX-HEAPIFY( A, i )
   ```
   Which is $O(1)$ except for MAX-HEAPIFY which is $O(\lg{n})$, so the whole procedure is $O(\lg{n})$.
