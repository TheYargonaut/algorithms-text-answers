2. Flip the comparisons and call Min-Heapify in the recursion. And rename 'largest' to 'smallest' to reflect new sementics. Same running time as Max-Heapify

3. Returns without effect (condition already satisfied)

4. Returns without effect (no children)

5. ```
   MAX-HEAPIFY-ITERATIVE( A, i )
      subroot = i
      while subroot > floor( A.heap-size / 2 )
         l = LEFT( subroot )
         r = RIGHT( subroot )
         largest = subroot
         if l <= A.heap-size and A[ l ] > A[ largest ]
            largest = l
         if r <= A.heap-size and A[ r ] > A[ largest ]
            largest = r
         if largest == subroot
            return
         exchange A[ subroot ] with A[ largest ]
         subroot = largest
   ```

6. MaxHeapify can touch at most one node in each layer; since there are at most $\lfloor\lg{n}\rfloor)$ layers (i.e. the height of the tree), the worst case running time is $\Omega(\lg{n})$
