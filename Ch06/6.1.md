# 6.1 Exercises

1. Minimum: $2^h$, Maximum: $2^{h+1}-1$

2. The distance to root from the last node is an iterative functionof the `Parent` proceedure, which applies $f(i)=\lfloor\frac{i}{2}\rfloor$ starting with $i=n$ until $i\leq1$. The integer number of iterations $m$ could be found by\
   $1=\lfloor\frac{i}{2^m}\rfloor$\
   $\lfloor2^m\rfloor=\lfloor i\rfloor$\
   $m=\lfloor\lg{i}\rfloor$

3. By induction, the root is the parent of the next (at most 2) nodes, and by the heapsort property is the maximum of the 3 top-level nodes. These nodes may each be considered the roots of their own sub-trees, of which they are each the maximum. This property applies recursively out to the leaves; thus, by being greater than any child maxima, the root is guaranteed to be the maximum of a subtree. (rough induction, not going to formalize more)

4. It may reside on any leaf of the heap

5. Iff it is sorted in non-decreasing order, yes.

6. No; element 6 is the parent of element 7, and $6\ngeq7$

7. The last element which is the parent of any node is found at $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ due to the definition of parent; all indices at most that contain a parent of at least one node; the indices above it, i.e. $[\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1,n]$ cannot be parent of any nodes, and therefore contain alll the leaves. QED.
