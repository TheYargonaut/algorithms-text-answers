1. Sorting: inventory cataloging systems, where any field might be chosen for sorting in a displayed order. Convex Hull: designing a perimiter fence for an industrial campus.
2. Memory requirements, power consumption (esp. in embedded systems), distributedness
3. Arrays. Fast assignment and access, slow insertion/deletion/resize
4. Similar in that they take place on a weighted graph where weights are distances and the goal is to minimize a traversal distance, different in that the shortest-path is a single trip between two points and travelling-salesman finds a cycle through multiple destinations.
5. Only the best: real-time video rendering; approximate: real-time opponent videogame AI
