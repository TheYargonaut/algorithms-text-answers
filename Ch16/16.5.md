1.  New set of tasks:\
    (4, 10), (2, 20), (4, 30), (3, 40), (1, 50), (4, 60), (6, 70)\
    New schedule, in order:\
    5346172\
    Pentalty: $p(1) + p(2) =  10 + 20 = 30$

2.  Since that property is equivalent to indepence, it is sufficient to show that property holds. Allocate a new array $T$ of size $|A|$ initialized with all zeros. Iterate through the elements of A and for each element $A_i$ increment the value of the position in $T$ which corresponds to its deadline $d$, if any (ignore for any $d > |A|$ since it cannot affect the independance of the set). Finally, iterate over the values in $T$, keeping a running sum. If that sum is ever greater than the current index, $A$ is not independent, otherwise, it is independent.\
The speed of this algorithm is $O(|A|)$ time to iterate once over $A$ and $O(|A|)$ time to iterate over $T$ for a total of $O(|A|)$ time.
