# 16.3 Exercises

1. Since $x.freq$ and $y.freq$ are the two lowest frequencies, we have $x.freq \leq a.freq$ and $y.freq \leq b.freq$ along with the original assumption. If $x.freq = b.freq$, this implies that all four values are equal.

2. Can eliminate node with only one branch to produce a prefix code with lesser or equal cost (though only equal in trivial case of all leaf symbols with frequency zero; the improvement is the node frequency).

3. a = 0000000\
   b = 0000001\
   c = 000001\
   d = 00001\
   e = 0001\
   f = 001\
   g = 01\
   h = 1\
   Generalizes to each symbol having $n-index$ zeros, followed by a one if $index > 1$. This follows from the $F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \geq \sum_{j=1}^{i-2}F_j$.

4. Exactly identical to current computation, since the frequency of each node is the combined frequency of its children and corresponds to the frequency of a single bit.

5. Roughly, because that's how accumulating frequencies work.

6. See [explanation](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap16/16.3/#163-6)

7. Just use a tree with 3 children (ternary tree) with same child selection metric. Proof nearly identical.

8. With the restriction of "no more than twice", the Huffman code will have 8-bit symbols for every character. This also follows from the entropy of the file measured at the character level, which is the lower-bound of symbols required to represent it.

9. Identical to 8, but in expectation.
