# 16.1 Exercises

1. elide

2. Swap the start-end times and make them negative and it's identical.

3. Shortest first: Say we have three activities, A [ 0, 5 ), B[ 4, 6 ), C[ 5, 10 ). This strategy would produce only activity C, when the optimal result is A, B.
   Least overlap first: Say we have eleven activities, [ 0, 1 ), [ 1, 3 ), [ 3, 5 ), [ 5, 6 ), 3x[ 0, 2 ), [ 2, 4 ), 3x[ 4, 6 ). This strategy would produce a result with 3 activities by choosing [ 2, 4 ) first, when the optimal solution contains 4 activities.
   Earliest start first: Say we have three activities, A [ 0, 3 ), B[ 1, 2 ), C[ 2, 3 ). This strategy would produce only activity A, when the optimal result is B, C.

4. Use the greedy activity selection algorithm repeatedly until all activities are scheduled. Each run fills a lecture hall.

5. Use the dynamic programming solution from earlier in the chapter but with the sum of values instead of the count as the maximization target.
