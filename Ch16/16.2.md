# 16.2 Exercises

1. By contradiction: if a value to put in poundage higher than the greedy solution existed, it would have been the greedy solution.

2. elide

3. Always choose items with greatest values (see [argument](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap16/16.2/))

4. Always fill up at the last stop before the water runs out. This problem has the greedy property.

5. Always choose a unit-length interval starting at the lowest-value un-contained point and extends as high as possible; this will only visit each point once after sorting, so $O( n\lg n )$.

6. Fill the knapsack with as much of the most valuable substance at any point, replacing the lowest-value substance. Only have to compare against the objects already in the knapsack (including empty) which have lower value; this is not dependant on n, and only touches each substance once, for a total of $O(n)$

7. It's just sorting $A$ and $B$ in increasing order. $O(n\lg n)$ in general.
