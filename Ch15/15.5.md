1. ```
   CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST-RECURSE( root, i, j, parent, side )
      if i > j
         if i <= parent:
            print "d" + ( i - 1 ) + " is the left child of k" + parent
         else
            print "d" + j + " is the right child of k" + parent
      else
         r = root[ i, j ]
         print "k" + r + " is the " + side + " child of k" + parent
         CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST-RECURSE( root, i, r - 1, "left" )
         CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST-RECURSE( root, r + 1, j, "right" )

   CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST( root )
      r = root[ 1, root.length ]
      print "k" + r + "is the root"
      CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST-RECURSE( root, 1, r - 1, "left" )
      CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST-RECURSE( root, r + 1, root.length, "right" )
   ```

2. Expected cost of optimal tree is 3.12\
   k5 is the root\
   k2 is the left child of k5\
   k1 is the left child of k2\
   d0 is the left child of k1\
   d1 is the right child of k1\
   k3 is the right child of k2\
   d2 is the left child of k3\
   k4 is the right child of k3\
   d3 is the left child of k4\
   d4 is the right child of k4\
   k7 is the right child of k5\
   k6 is the left child of k7\
   d5 is the left child of k6\
   d6 is the right child of k6\
   d7 is the right child of k7

3. Would become $O(n^4)$
