# 3.1 Exercises

1. Obvious, eliding exercise
2. Obvious, eliding exercise
3. It states A is asymptotically less than or equal to some function greater than or equal to $cn^2$. That is, it states no meaningful bound.
4. Yes. $2^{n+1}=2*2^n$, so $2^{n+1} < c2^{n}$ for $c \geq 2$\
   No. $2^{2n}=4^n$, and $c2^n \geq 4^n$ has no asymptotically true solution
5. Obvious, eliding exercise.
6. Theorem 3.1, plus meaning of worst-case and best-case generalizing to the whole algorithm.
7. No overlap possible, nothing greater and less than tight asymptotic bound.
