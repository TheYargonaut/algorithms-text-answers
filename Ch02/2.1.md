2. ```
   for j = 2 to A.length
      key = A[ j ]
      i = j - 1
      while i > 0 and A[ i ] < key
         A[ i + 1 ] = A[ i ]
         i = i - 1
      A[ i + 1 ] = key
   ```

3. ```
   for i = 1 to A.length
      if A[ i ] == v
         return i
   return NIL
   ```

   At the start of each iteration of the for loop in lines 1-3, the subarray $A[ 1 . . i-1 ]$ does not contain the value $v$.
   
   At initialization it is trivially true ($A[1..i-1]$ is empty). It maintains this invariant by returning if $v$ is found before incrementing $i$. When the algorithm returns, the return value must either be the index of the first instance of $i$, or the value $NIL$ because $A$ does not contain $v$.

4. Consider the problem of addition:\
   **Input**: Two n-element binary sequences $A=(a_1, a_2,..., a_n)$ and $B=(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) and one (n+1)-element binary sequence $C=(c_1, c_2,..., c_n)$, each of which encodes an unsigned integer in little-endian bit order, values $\hat{A}$, $\hat{B}$, and $\hat{C}$.\
   **Output**: Set the elements of $C$ such that $\hat{C}=\hat{A}+\hat{B}$.
   ```
   c = False
   for i = 1 to n
      C[ i ] = ( A[ i ] AND B[ i ] AND c ) OR ( A[ i ] AND NOT B[ i ] AND NOT c ) OR OR ( NOT A[ i ] AND B[ i ] AND NOT c ) OR ( NOT A[ i ] AND NOT B[ i ] AND c ) 
      c = ( A[ i ] AND B[ i ] ) OR ( A[ i ] AND c ) OR ( B[ i ] AND c ) 
   C[ n + 1 ] = c
