      let L[ 1 .. n_1 + 1 ] and R[ 1 .. $n_2$ + 1 ] be new arrays

   |2|2|2|

   Holds by induction

4. where $c$ is the time necessary to move an element:\
   $T(n) = 0$ if $n = 1$, $T(n-1) + cn$ if $n > 1$

5. ```
   BSEARCH( v, A )
      high = A.length
      low = 0
      while low < high:
         i = floor( ( high + low ) / 2 )
         if A[ i ] == v
            return i
         if A[ i ] < v
            low = i + 1
         else
            high = i
      return NIL
   ```
   Search area halves each iteration, and each iteration runs in constant time. Thus there are at most $\lg{n}$ iterations and the worst-case running time is $\Theta(\lg{n})$

6. No, because the algorithm will still have to shift on average $n/2$ elements; this linear burden still dominates and keeps the algorithm $\Theta(n^2)$.

7. Sort the elements using Merge Sort, which is $\Theta(n\lg{n})$. Next, starting with the outermost elements (at $0$ and $n$), track the indices and compare the sum of the elements to the target value. If the sum is larger than the target value, increment the index of the lower tracker; if the sum is smaller than the target value, decrement the index of the higher tracker; return True if they are equal. Continue to iterate; if the indices tracked become equal, return False. This half of the algorithm will run in at most $n$ constant-time steps. Since $\Theta(n\lg{n}) + \Theta(n) = \Theta(n\lg{n})$, this algorithm will achieve the desired time.
