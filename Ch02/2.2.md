# 2.2 Exercises

1. $\Theta(n^3)$

2. ```
   for j = 1 to n - 1\
      imin = j\
      for i = ( j + 1 ) to n\
         if A[ i ] < A[ j ]\
            imin = i\
      if imin != j
         min = A[ imin ]\
         A[ imin ] = A[ j ]\
         A[ j ] = min
   ```
   
   Loop invariant: At the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, every element in $A[ 1 .. ( j - 1 ) ]$ is smaller than every element in the rest of $A$. At the beginning of every iteration of the inner loop, $A[ imin ]$ is the least-valued element of $A[ j .. ( i - 1 ) ]$.

   The outer loop only needs to run for the first $n - 1$ elements because the loop invariant guarantees that every element of $A[ 1 .. (n - 1) ]$ is less than $A[ n ]$.

   Best-case and worst-case running time are identical in big-theta notation: $\Theta(n^2)$

3. Average: $n/2$ (average location of randomly-assigned element)\
   Worst case: $n$ (find at the end)\
   Big-theta notations for these cases are identical: $\Theta(n)$

4. Check to see if the problem is already solved or, similarly, make and check a random guess at the solution.
