# 12.2 Exercises

1. c

2. elide

3. replace `.right` with `.left` and `-MINIMUM` with `-MAXIMUM`

4. Suppose we have the following tree:\
   3\
   +-1\
   +-+-0\
   +-+-2\
   and you search for 0. 2 will be to the right of the search path, but will be less than 3, which is on the search path.

5. Consequence of `SUCCESSOR` going down to the first in the right sub-tree without left child and `PREDECESSOR` going down to the first in the left sub-tree without a right child.

6. By the tree property, that is the first element greater than $x$; any other key which would be between the two would have to be in the right tree of $x$, which doesn't exist.

7. The algorithm visits each node and edge at most twice; the sum of the number of nodes and edges is $O(n)$ since the number of edges originating from any node is at most 2. Since it visits each node at least once, it is $\Omega(n)$. Therefore, this algorithm has time complexity $\Theta(n)$

8. Maximum edges traversed in a single call would be from a leaf to the root, or $h$ edges, which occurs only at one transition. The algorithm must also touch at least $k$ nodes. Therefore, it is $O(k+h)$.

9. The only keys with values between that of two nodes (where one is an ancestor of the other) must have them both as ancestors by the binary search tree property. Since the leaf nodes have no descendents, there are no intermediate values between them and their parent, making them the adjacent values.
