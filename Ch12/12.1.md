# 12.1 Exercises

1. Elide

2. Min-heap pust the smallest element at the root of each subtree. It can be used to print the keys in sorted order in the same way it can be used to sort a list; however, it will do so in $O(n\lg n)$ instead of $O(n)$ because it does not constrain the subtrees with respect to eachother.

3. ```
   INORDER-TREE-WALK-POINTER(x)
      last = NIL
      while x != NIL
         if last == x.p
            last = x
            if x.left == NIL
               if x.right == NIL
                  print x.key
                  x = x.p
               else
                  x = x.right
            else
               x = x.left
               
         if last == x.left
            last = x
            print x.key
            if x.right == NIL
               x = x.p
            else
               x = x.right
         
         // last == x.right
         last = x
         x = x.p
   ```

4. Just move `print x.key` up or down a line (respectively).

5. Because printing the sorted list can be done in worst-case linear time, construction must be $\Omega(n)$ or else contradict the results for comparison sort.
