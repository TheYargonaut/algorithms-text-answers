# 12.4 Exercises

1. $\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\binom{i+3}{3}$\
   $\displaystyle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{(i+3)!}{i!3!}$\
   $\displaystyle=\frac1{3!}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(i+3)(i+2)(i+1)$\
   $\displaystyle=\frac1{3!4}(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)n$\
   $\displaystyle=\frac{(n+3)!}{(n-1)!4!}$

2. Tree where most of the nodes are in one branch from the root (nearly linked list) with the other sub-tree being nearly balanced and added to once every $k$ insertions. Asymptotically linear in height but logarithmic in average height.

3. Simple: there is only one ordering which produces the tallest tree with all right children (strictly increasing order), while two orderings can produce the next-worse ordering with the leaves being one left-child and one right-child. If each ordering has an equal chance of occurring, then these two trees have different probabilities of occurring. QED.\
   As an aside, this pattern indicates that when all input sequences are equally likely, more-ballanced trees are more likely than less-ballanced trees.

4. $\frac{d^2}{{dx}^2}f(x)=\frac{d^2}{{dx}^2}e^{x\ln2}=(\ln^22)e^{x\ln2}>0\forall x\in \mathcal R$

5. Not rigorous because I'm not completely sure what it's asking, but I expect the answer has something to do with characterizing it as a decision tree equivalent to a binary search tree where the pivot is inserted and make the conclusion based on the asymptotic height probabilities of the randomized tree.
