# 14.3 Exercises

1. Look at children, choose max of their max or my own endpoint.

2. Use dummy values for the open sides, treat as negative or positive infinity respectively. Nothing else changes.

3. Same as interval search, go to left whenever possible. track overlap seen, return one seen with lowest. Can do some early-stopping before getting to leaves, but overall worst case $O(\lg n)$

4. Recurse downward on any subtree which might have overlaps, pushing those which do onto a stack. This provides the time required.

5. Just needs the new procedure; search based on lower endpoint, check upper.

6. Instead of size, maintain a min-gap at each node, computed as the minimum of the min-gaps from each subtree and that of the node to the predecessor and successor; `INF` is used where an adjacent node would be null.
