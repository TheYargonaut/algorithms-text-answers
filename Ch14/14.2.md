# 14.2 Exercises

1. Maintain `T.min` and `T.max` pointers (O(1) addition to each insert/delete) and add a `.successor` and `.predecessor` pointer to each node (O(1) addition to each insert/delete). No asymptotic effect.

2. Heights yes, because limited (upward) update. The same cannot be done for depths.

3. compute with $x.left.f \circledast x.a \circledast x.right.f$ starting with x as the new lower node and then as the new upper node, for $2*O(1)=O(1)$ time. The `size` attribute is exactly this for the addition operator and $x.a=1 \forall x$

4. Use a modified `SEARCH` to find the smallest key greater than or equal to $a$. Use the normal binary tree `SUCCESSOR` procedure to get each key less than or equal to $b$. This procedure fulfills the time requirement.
