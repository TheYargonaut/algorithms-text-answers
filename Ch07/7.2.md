# 7.2 Exercises

1. tedious, elide

2. $O(n^2)$ as presented last time, though it is $O(n\lg{n})$ with the modifications proposed in exercise 7.1-2

3. Takes the worse partition each time (though the opposite one to pre-sorte in non-decreasing order), so $n*\Theta(n)=\Theta(n^2)$ runtime.

4. Quicksort would take mostly bad partitions, running in nearly $\Theta(n^2)$ time; meanwhile, insertion sort would rarely have to insert more than a few elements back, running in nearly $\Theta(n)$ time

5. Obvious and tedious, elide

6. Tedious, elide
