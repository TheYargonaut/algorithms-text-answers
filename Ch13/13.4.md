# 13.4 Exercises

1. If the root it touched, it is unconditionally set black after terminating the loop.

2. It sets $x$ to black, immediately restoring property 4.

3. Elide

4. Any look at $w$'s children. Note that no parent call ever looks at `T.nil` since the loop terminates when $x$ is `T.root`.

5. ||$\alpha$|$\beta$|$\gamma$|$\delta$|$\epsilon$|$\zeta$|
   |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
   |(b)|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|
   |(c)|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$1+count(c)$|$1+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|
   |(d)|$2+count(c)$|$2+count(c)$|$1+count(c)+count(c')$|$1+count(c)+count(c')$|$1+count(c)$|$1+count(c)$|

6. $w$ is red in case 1, so since $w.p=x.p$, $x.p$ must be black.

7. Not necessarily; a node which was previously a left child may be left a right child or vice versa.
