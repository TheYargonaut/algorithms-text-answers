# 11.3 Exercises

1. Hash the search key and compare it with the hash values during the search, only comparing the keys themselves when the hash matches. This method will avoid expensive comparisons except during colisions or when the correct key is found.

2. ```
   // only uses storage up to large enough to hold max( m - 1, 128 )*( m - 1 ) using properties of modulus
   HASH-STR( S )
      hash = 0
      factor = 1
      for i in 1..S.length
         t = ( S[ i ] * factor ) % m
         hash = ( hash + t ) % m
         factor = ( 128 * factor ) % m
      return hash
   ```

3. $2^p\mod(2^p-1)=1$, so each summed character interpreted in radix is itself; that is, $c*2^p\mod m=c\mod m$, and the hash is simply the sum of characters $\mod m$. Because of commutivity of addition, all permutations of a string hash to the same value. Any application where anagrams exist would have more collisions; one egregious application would devices on a test bed named by their connections: dut123, dut312, dut321, all have the same hash.

5. Roughly, average probability of collision in hash from U to B must be at least $\frac1{|B|}-\frac1{|U|}$, so the maximum must be at least that value.
