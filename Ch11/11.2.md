3. Insertions become linear, searches stay linear but the unsuccessful search coefficient decreases by an expected factor of 2.

4. Singly-linked list, treat it as a stack so addition/removal can stay on the same end and keep $O(1)$ deletion.

5. Average subset of keys which collide is $\frac{|U|}{m}>n$, which implies there is at least one group of colliding keys of cardinality at least $n$.

6. sum and seek to result: O(m) + O(m/n)\
   Uniformly choose random index `i = RANDOM( 1, m )`\
   Uniformly choose random element `e = RANDOM( 1, L )`\
   If `e` is greater than the length of the list at the chosen index, reject it and return to the beginning. Otherwise, return the chosen element.\
   Probability of rejection $(n/m)/L$, so expected number of loops is $O(L/\alpha)$. Add the expected seek time to element in chain $O(L)$ for total of $O(L(1+1/\alpha))$.
